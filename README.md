## Why do Founders and DAOs apply?

Many of us _are_ founders -- and have _personally_ experienced the challenges of
starting companies, open-source projects, and DAOs. At the Funding Cooperative
DAO we do NOT solve all of these challenges.

This repository contains sources for our documentation project, which you can find at FIXME.
=======

The Funding Cooperative DAO is a new approach to help founders while increasing dramatically the number of qualified web3 founders. Founders and DAOs accepted as members of the Funding Cooperative DAO receive a shared token in return for a small portion of their tokens. This creates diversification, jump-starts community creation, and provides some liquidity as well.  Gains are recycled into outreach and education, focusing especially on underrepresented groups. &#x20;

## Why do Founders and DAOs apply?

Many of us _are_ founders - and have _personally_ experienced the challenges of starting companies, open-source projects, and DAOs. At the Funding Cooperative DAO we do NOT solve all of these challenges. However we can, with your help, address:

#### Diversification: &#x20;

* Investors have diversification - we think Founders and their DAOs should as well.

#### Liquidity:

* Our shared tokens are attractive to investors as a way to cost-effectively gain exposure to quality founders and to participate in the often outsized gains as founders go from 0 to 1. &#x20;

#### Community:

* By becoming a part of a DAO of DAOs established by the Funding Cooperative DAO - DAOs link arms with each other and support each other on their journey.&#x20;
