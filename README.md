## Why do Founders and DAOs apply?

Many of us _are_ founders -- and have _personally_ experienced the challenges of
starting companies, open-source projects, and DAOs. At the Funding Cooperative
DAO we do NOT solve all of these challenges.

This repository contains sources for our documentation project, which you can find at FIXME.
