# How does the FC DAO work?

!!! info "There are three parts of the Funding Cooperative DAO"

    1. Shared DAOs for groups of founders and their DAOs, represented by a
       shared token.
    2. The Funding Cooperative DAO itself -- which helps to find, screen, create
       and support the shared DAOs.
    3. Outreach and grants -- the Funding Cooperative DAO is committed to
       recycling 50% or more of gains over time into outreach and training
       founders, focusing on underrepresented groups around the world.

## Shared DAOs

Projects are containers for task lists. Think of them as a library for
everything your team needs to get done to complete or ship a project.

## Funding Cooperative DAO operations

Hit the big `+` button in your sidebar and select `New Project` from the menu
that pops up. Give your project a name, and you're good to go!

## Outreach and grants

There are a number of groups growing the web3 ecosystem including GitCoin,
Movement DAO, SeedCamp, BuildSpace and many others. We intend to support their
efforts. We are also building software to proactively assess and reach out to
interesting-looking founders around the world, with a particular focus on under
represented groups.
